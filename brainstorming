Rules of the Game:
-------------------

  penalty for hints
  
  point(s) per round of play - who is faster?
    could do this by providing a new deal with a newly shuffled deck for each player's turn

  points for number of sets found?
    this would require allowing both players to play at the same time
    if we implement the GUI with clicking, the players would have to share the mouse
    the players would need to click "I'm player 1" or "I'm player 2" before selecting their set
    this would give the point(s) to the correct player
