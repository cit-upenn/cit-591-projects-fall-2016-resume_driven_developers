--------------------
Swap's Suggestions:
--------------------

	Vertical breakdown instead of horizontal - what would that look like for our project?
	what are the features each of us could be responsible for?
	
	Meet with Vicky once a week
	
	Deadline is "flexible"
	
-------------
Issues:
-------------

	Based on Sarah Gray's talk, it sounds like our first priority is to break our project down into very small chunks.
	Do we want to use the Travis-CI for testing?
	We have only 2 weeks to do this project once Thanksgiving Break is over. What are our goals/internal deadlines?
		For example, we might say we want to have "this and that" done by "this date".

Rules of the Game:

1-Player Version

  the 1-player version seems like a good place to correlate the score to the time taken
  
  perhaps the ultimate goal is to clear the whole deck and the less time taken, the better the score

  penalty for hints
    
+++++++++++++++++
2-Player Version
+++++++++++++++++

  penalty for hints

  point(s) per round of play - who is faster?
    could do this by providing a new deal with a newly shuffled deck for each player's turn

  points for number of sets found?
    this would require allowing both players to play at the same time
    if we implement the GUI with clicking, the players would have to share the mouse
    the players would need to click "I'm player 1" or "I'm player 2" before selecting their set
    this would give the point(s) to the correct player

-------------
GUI??
-------------

  look at last year's projects
      one group created a class that extended JFrame - this involved importing javax.swing.JFrame
      another group used ActionListener and MouseListener - my guess is this is how you get user input like a mouse click
      after briefly looking through the Oracle Jave documentation for JFrames, this is less overwhelming!
  read textbook
  Google GUI platforms that work with Java/Eclipse
  ask Vicky for her advice
